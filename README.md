Sick of the lacklustre templates for C++ development in Xcode4?
We've made a start on some that are worth using.

Usage
=====

Clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/phere/Xcode4-CPP-Templates.git

Move or copy the `Phere` directory into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates`

The new templates should now show up whenever you create a new file from within Xcode.

Last verified with Xcode 4.4.0
